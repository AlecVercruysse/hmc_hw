\begin{problem}[1]
  Let $f(x) = \alpha x^2+\beta x + \gamma$ be an arbitrary quadratic function. Show that the number $c$ that satisfies the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem on the interval $[a, b]$ is given by the midpoint $c = \frac{a+b}{2}$. \\

  (Curiously, the value of $c$ is independent of the quadratic's coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$!)

\begin{problem}[2]
  Set $f(x) = x^{-1}$, $a = -1$, $b = 1$. Verify that there is no number $c$ for which
  \[ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}. \]
  Explain how this does not violate the Mean Value Theorem.

\begin{problem}[5]
  The area between two varying concentric circles is at all times $9\pi^2$.
  The rate of change of the area of the larger circle is $10\pi^2 \text{ in}^2$/sec.
  How fast is the circumference of the smaller circle changing when it has area $16\pi^2 \text{ in}^2$?

\begin{problem}[6]
  Suppose that $f$ and $g$ and are unknown differentiable functions that satisfy the relationships
  \begin{align}{2} \label{eq:1}
    f'(x) c= g(x) \text{\quad and\quad} g'(x) = -f(x) \text{\quad for all } x
  \end{align}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Show that $f^2(x) + g^2(x) = C$ for some constant $C$.
  \item Determine the value of $C$ if we also know $f(0) = 0$ and $g(0) = 1$.
  \item Differentiate the equations for $f'$ and $g'$ in (\ref{eq:1}) to show that $f$ and $g$ must also solve the differential equations
    \[ f''(x) + f(x) = 0 \text{\quad and\quad} g''(x) + g(x) = 0 \text{\quad for all } x. \]
