\begin{problem}[1]
  Determine the equilibrium strategies for the row and column players when the payoff matrix is given below and determine the value of the game.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
      2 & -3 \\
      \hline
      -5 & 8 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}

\begin{problem}[2]
  Consider a general 2 x 2 game,
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
      \hline
     $A$ & $B$ \\ \hline
     $C$ & $D$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  Assuming that we do not have dominated strategies, and that $A + D \neq B + C$, define $E = A + D - B - C$.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Prove that the value of this game is $V = (AD - BC)/E$ by showing that the row player can assure a payout of $V$ by playing row 1 with probability $(D-C)/E$ (and therefore row 2 with probability $(A-B)/E$), and that the column player can assure that same payout by playing column 1 with probability $(D-B)/E$ (and therefore row 2 with probability $(A-C)/E$).
  \item Verify your answer in problem 1 using this formula.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[3]
  In the game of Weighted Rock/Paper/Scissors, the game is played in the usual way, but if you win with Rock, you get \$10, if you win with Paper you get \$3, and if you win with Scissors, you get \$1.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Construct the payoff matrix for this game.
  \item Verify that the equilibrium strategy for both players is to play Rock, Paper and Scissors with respective probabilities 1/14, 10/14, 3/14.
  \item What would the equilibrium strategy be if the weights were positive numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$?
